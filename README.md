# Disease Prediction Website

For **HackHub 2022** we chose the track of **Health Care** and we decided to work on the streams of _Machine Learning/Data Science_ and _Web Development_. This website is created to help medical workers and health professionals accurately predict if a patient has a high or low chance of contracting either **Diabetes or Heart Disease**. This can greatly help doctors and medical professionals as they can easily recommend/prescribe medicines and diets accordingly. It also helps the patient be more aware of their health condition and can motivate them to lead a healthy lifestyle. Doing so can be a great benefit for the well-being of our society.

As for the project at hand, we have created a user-friendly design and have successfully implemented the design through the means of _HTML, CSS and Javascript_. We have used a One Page Website Design, where we have showcased our use of web development and data science.

We have created two web applications through the means of **Streamlit** for our Machine Learning/Data Science pages, where the medical professional can enter the data from the patients' lab report and obtain the prediction given by the algorithm. This streamlit web application has been deployed on _Heroku_, which can be accessed from our Website.
